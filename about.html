    <p>Founded as The New York Zoological Society on April 26, 1895, The Wildlife Conservation Society was founded by Madison Grant, Andrew H. Green, and Henry F. Osborn. The organization was originally created with the goals to: Open up a zoological park, Promote the study of zoology, and to Preserve wildlife.
